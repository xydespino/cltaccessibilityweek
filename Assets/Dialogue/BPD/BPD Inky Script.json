In his second year of university, Dmitri did very well in his first year, obtaining an “A” in all of his classes.","\n","^Narrator: As a single parent, he is not able to start schoolwork until after his Alexia is fed, bathed, and put to bed, and after chores like dishes and laundry are completed.","\n","^Narrator: He often works until midnight, and then needs to get up at 6 a.m. to get Alexia ready, catch the bus, take Alexia to the daycare, and then walk to the university. Dmitri is not getting enough sleep.","\n","^Narrator: By October, however, things have suddenly changed and he has boundless energy. This is the complete opposite to the depressions he’s had—then, he couldn’t get out of bed. Now, he doesn’t need sleep!","\n","^Narrator: He is able to work until 5 am, and then get up at 6 am and get out the door with Alexia.","\n","^Narrator: Even though he gets to the university on time, he seldom attends class because realizes he is much smarter than all the other students and no longer needs to attend class, other than to hand in assignments and for the midterm and final exams.","\n","^Narrator: Instead, he hangs out playing pool, walking along the riverbank trails for hours, and going to the campus bar.","\n","^Narrator: Always shy, he’s now boisterous, always laughing loudly, and having a million conversations, talking a mile a minute.","\n","^Narrator: Sometimes people don’t seem to understand what he’s talking about, but again, he knows he’s smarter than them and he’s the funniest person in the room--they just don’t get it.","\n","^Narrator: Sitting at my desk in my office, I suddenly hear my door swing open. It is Dmitri, a student I had reached out to meet with.","\n","^Narrator: He hadn’t confirmed he would attend, so I am a bit surprised to see him here. He barged in fifteen minutes late without knocking, but I decide to greet him with a smile nonetheless.","\n","^Dr. Higashi: Ah, glad you could make it, Dmitri. Have a seat.","\n","^Dmitri: Naw, I’m good.","\n","^Narrator: Dmitri continues to stand there, shifting his body weight back and forth and fidgeting. An awkward pause follows.","\n","^Dr. Higashi: I want to talk to you about the course. Your grades have been dropping and you have been missing nearly every class.","\n","^Narrator: Dmitri rolls his eyes. He seems to be acting a bit differently than usual.","\n","^Narrator: On one hand, his behavior strikes me as disrespectful, but I would also like to find out why he is suddenly struggling in class.","\n","ev","str","^I'm irritated with Dmitri's behaviour...","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^I'm curious why Dmitri is struggling in class...","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-1","flg":4},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"irritated"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["\n",{"->":"curious"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"irritated":[["^Dr. Higashi: I want to talk to you about the course.

No, probably not. Simple people can’t see genius.","\n","^The nerve! Taken aback, I fire back.","\n","^Dr. Higashi: Like I said, you seemed like a good student at the beginning of term.
