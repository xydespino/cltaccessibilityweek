We haven’t had any new junior developers in a while now.","\n","^Rowan: But with all this work piled up, I guess I don’t have time to interview anyone. I’ll ask our director to handle the hiring process.","\n","^One week passes..","\n","^Rowan: Welcome Arwah to our team! I am Rowan, your manager.","\n","^Arwah: Hi, nice to meet you.","\n","^Rowan: I will give you a tour of the place, introduce you to everyone, and I’ll send you an email on all the setup instructions to get you up to speed.","\n","^Arwah: Sounds good, thanks!","\n","^Arwah: *eager and happy to meet everyone, she takes a little bit too long to move on after engaging in small talk with her new colleagues.*","\n","^Rowan: *notices this but thinks nothing of it. * ","\n","^One month passes..","\n","^Gloria (a senior developer): *leaves a meeting room along with Rowan*","\n","^Gloria: Hi Rowan, I need to talk to you about Arwah’s performance in the last sprint.","\n","^Rowan: Hi Gloria, I have some time now before my next meeting.","\n","^Gloria: Rowan lately has been late on delivering her tasks. At the beginning, she was still getting familiar with our code base and that’s understandable...","\n","^Gloria: .. But even after two months, she can’t deliver her tasks on time. ","\n","^Rowan: Is that so... ","\n","^Rowan to herself: *I noticed she has been missing meetings often as well*.","\n","^Rowan: Did you have check-in calls with her to see if she has impediments that are delaying her progress on tasks.","\n","^Gloria: I have... I asked her why she is not able to deliver her work on time and meet her deadlines, but she just said that she is unable to plan for work.","\n","^Rowan: Ok, thanks for letting me know. Just try to have regular check-ins with her to make sure she has all she needs to work on her tasks. And I’ll follow up on that later.","\n","^The week passes.. *Rowan is having dinner with a friend. * ","\n","^Camila: It’s been such a long week at work. Have you been getting any time to relax? I know you’ve barely been able to make time for this dinner.","\n","^Rowan: *Rowan sighs*","\n","^Rowan: Honestly, I can’t relax as much as I’d like to. I supervise an employee that I recently hired at work, she doesn’t meet her deadlines and always joins meetings remotely.","\n","^Rowan: Just as I thought our workload would get more reasonable, it’s now WAY more hectic. She is still on probation, and I am considering hiring someone else.","\n","^Rowan: I don’t think that’s very convenient because the new hire will also need time to get up to speed.","\n","^Camila: Wow, Rowan slips up when hiring an employee, that’s got to hit the news!","\n","^Rowan: *Rowan shrugs* I didn’t interview her myself. That was our HR contractor.","\n","^Camila: *Camila Laughs* That sounds about right. Did you talk with the HR contractor about the reasoning behind hiring her and if they have information that could be useful.","\n","^Rowan: I have, all they said was that she met all the job requirements and that they need consent for any further information disclosure.","\n","^Camila: Wait a minute, I have an acquaintance who said he has similar challenges doing his work, he said she had some sort of a disability. Maybe you can talk to an accessibility expert to get some information?","\n",["ev",{"^->":"rowanItIsGetting.0.70.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Rowan: (Give Arwah a chance for her performance to improve before deciding to let her go)",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"rowanItIsGetting.0.71.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":2},{"s":["^Rowan: (Let Arwah go by the end of the week and hire someone new ASAP)",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"rowanItIsGetting.0.72.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-2","flg":2},{"s":["^Rowan: (Meet with Camila’s acquaintance, and see how to best help Arwah adjust to new work environment)",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"rowanItIsGetting.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.70.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.twoWeeksLater"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"rowanItIsGetting.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.71.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.oneWeekLater"},{"#f":5}],"c-2":["ev",{"^->":"rowanItIsGetting.0.c-2.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.72.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.^.nextMonday"},{"#f":5}]}],{"twoWeeksLater":["^Two weeks later..","\n","^Rowan (to herself): I have an email from Arwah.","\n","^Arwah’s email: “Hi Rowan, There is something I wanted to bring up.

I don’t understand. I thought I was doing okay...","\n","^Rowan: You’ve been behind on almost all your tasks which I’ve assigned you. Our stand-up meetings have brought almost no progress until the last few days of the project milestone deadlines.","\n","^Rowan: Our team has been waiting on you to complete your tasks and it has been slowing us down further.","\n","^Rowan: For that reason, we cannot afford to keep you on the team any longer. Feel free to take the rest of the day to pack up your things, HR will ensure that you get the paperwork you need.","\n","^Arwah: *looks down and a tear falls from her eye as she slowly walks out of Rowan’s office.
